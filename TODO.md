# AI Context Gap Tracker - TODO List

This document outlines potential pitfalls in the AI Context Gap Tracker project, both at the idea and implementation levels, along with proposed corrections.

## Idea-Level Pitfalls

### 1. Ambiguous Definition of "Context Gap"
*   **Pitfall:** The term "context gap" is broad and lacks a precise definition, which can hinder effective identification, measurement, and addressing of these gaps.
*   **Correction:** Clearly define what constitutes a "context gap" within the project's scope. For example, "the absence of critical user-provided information required for an AI model to generate an accurate and relevant response, leading to a low confidence score or a generic output." This definition should guide the development of the `contexttracker` and `responseauditor` modules.

### 2. Over-reliance on a Single AI Model/Approach
*   **Pitfall:** Designing the system around a single AI model can lead to rigidity and difficulty in adapting to new models or evolving AI capabilities.
*   **Correction:** Design the `logicengine` and `promptrewriter` to be model-agnostic. Use abstract interfaces for AI model interactions, allowing for easy swapping or integration of different models (e.g., via an adapter pattern) to ensure future flexibility.

### 3. Lack of Clear Success Metrics
*   **Pitfall:** Without quantifiable metrics, it's challenging to determine if the "context gap tracker" is effectively improving AI performance or user experience.
*   **Correction:** Establish clear, measurable success metrics such as: reduction in AI model hallucination rates, increase in user satisfaction scores, decrease in interaction turns, or improved accuracy of AI responses. The `responseauditor` module should be used to collect data for these metrics.

## Implementation-Level Pitfalls

### 1. Scalability Bottlenecks (Database & Redis)
*   **Pitfall:** The database (`internal/database/database.go`) and Redis (`pkg/redis/redis.go`) could become performance bottlenecks under increased load if not optimized.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Database:** Implement proper indexing, connection pooling, and consider sharding or replication. Regularly review and optimize slow queries.
    *   **Redis:** Optimize Redis usage for caching and session management. Ensure efficient key design and consider Redis Cluster for high availability and horizontal scaling.

### 2. Performance of NLP and Prompt Rewriting
*   **Pitfall:** The Python NLP component (`python-nlp/`) and the `promptrewriter` could introduce significant latency due to complex computations or external API calls.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Asynchronous Processing:** Implement asynchronous processing for NLP tasks using message queues to decouple the main request flow from heavy computations.
    *   **Caching:** Cache results of frequently rewritten prompts or NLP analyses in Redis.
    *   **Optimization:** Profile and optimize the Python NLP code. Consider using optimized NLP libraries or pre-trained models.
    *   **Batching:** Batch multiple NLP requests if applicable to reduce overhead.

### 3. Inter-service Communication (Go and Python)
*   **Pitfall:** Inefficient or unreliable communication between the Go backend and the Python NLP service can lead to errors, latency, and data inconsistencies.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Robust API:** Implement a robust, well-defined API (e.g., RESTful HTTP or gRPC) with proper error handling, timeouts, and retries.
    *   **Containerization:** Use Docker (`Dockerfile`, `python-nlp/Dockerfile`) and Docker Compose (`docker-compose.yml`) for consistent deployment and environment management.
    *   **Health Checks:** Implement health checks for both services to ensure they are running and responsive.

### 4. Data Consistency and Integrity
*   **Pitfall:** Maintaining data consistency across different components and storage layers can be challenging.
*   **Correction:** Implement transactional operations where necessary. Use database constraints and validation rules to maintain data integrity. Consider eventual consistency models for less critical data if performance is paramount.

### 5. Error Handling and Observability
*   **Pitfall:** Poor error handling can lead to silent failures, and a lack of logging/monitoring makes debugging difficult.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Centralized Logging:** Implement structured logging across all components and send logs to a centralized system. Include relevant context in logs.
    *   **Metrics and Monitoring:** Integrate with a monitoring system (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) to collect metrics on API response times, error rates, and performance. Define alerts for critical thresholds.
    *   **Robust Error Handling:** Implement comprehensive error handling with clear error messages and appropriate error types.

### 6. Security
*   **Pitfall:** Handling sensitive data or API keys without proper security measures can lead to breaches.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Environment Variables:** Use environment variables for sensitive configurations (e.g., API keys, database credentials) as suggested by `.env.example`.
    *   **Input Validation:** Validate all inputs to prevent injection attacks.
    *   **Access Control:** Implement proper authentication and authorization for API endpoints. Consider RBAC.
    *   **Data Encryption:** Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit.

### 7. Maintainability and Testability
*   **Pitfall:** A complex system without clear separation of concerns or adequate testing can become difficult to maintain and extend.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Modular Design:** Continue with the modular design and ensure clear interfaces between modules.
    *   **Unit and Integration Tests:** Write comprehensive unit tests and integration tests. Ensure the existing `scripts/test_system.sh` is thorough.
    *   **Documentation:** Maintain up-to-date documentation for the API (`docs/API.md`) and deployment (`docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`).

## Integration with Claude Desktop (MCP Server Component)

To integrate the AI Context Gap Tracker with Claude Desktop, an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server component needs to be developed, preferably in Python, to expose the tracker's functionalities as tools.

### 1. Develop a Python MCP Server
*   **Task:** Create a new Python application that acts as an MCP server. This server will expose the core functionalities of the AI Context Gap Tracker (prompt rewriting and response auditing) as MCP tools.
*   **Details:**
    *   Utilize the `mcp` Python SDK (e.g., `FastMCP`) to define and register tools.
    *   The MCP server will communicate with the existing Go-based AI Context Gap Tracker services (e.g., `promptrewriter`, `responseauditor`) via their internal APIs (e.g., HTTP/gRPC).
    *   Example tools to expose:
        *   `rewrite_prompt(original_prompt: str) -> str`: Calls the Go `promptrewriter` service.
        *   `audit_response(original_response: str, context: str) -> str`: Calls the Go `responseauditor` service.

## Universal MCP Server Implementation

To ensure the AI Context Gap Tracker's MCP server can work with any MCP-compliant host application, not just Claude Desktop, it needs to be designed as a universal and robust implementation.

### 1. Universality of the Model Context Protocol (MCP)
*   **Concept:** The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a universal standard designed to allow host applications to interact with external tools and services. An MCP server, once implemented, can theoretically connect to any application that supports the MCP specification.
*   **Goal:** The aim is to create an MCP server for the AI Context Gap Tracker that is a robust, standard-compliant implementation, decoupled from any host-specific logic. The host application (e.g., Claude Desktop, VS Code extension, custom IDE) will handle its own configuration to connect to this universal MCP server.

### 2. Setting Up and Running the Universal MCP Server
Running the AI Context Gap Tracker as a universal MCP server involves two main components:

#### a. Running the AI Context Gap Tracker Backend (Go Services)
*   **Task:** Ensure the core Go services of the AI Context Gap Tracker are running and accessible. These services provide the actual functionalities (e.g., prompt rewriting, response auditing) that the MCP server will expose.
*   **Details:**
    *   Navigate to the root directory of the `AI-context-gap-tracker` project.
    *   Execute the Docker Compose command to build and run all necessary Go services:
        ```bash
        docker-compose up --build
        ```
    *   Verify that the Go services (e.g., `promptrewriter`, `responseauditor`, `server`) are running and their APIs are accessible (e.g., typically on `http://localhost:8080` or another configured port).

#### b. Running the Python MCP Server
*   **Task:** The Python application developed as the MCP server needs to be executed and made accessible to host applications.
*   **Details:**
    *   **For Development (Direct Execution):**
        *   Once the Python MCP server application (`main.py` or similar) is developed, it can be run directly from the command line:
            ```bash
            python /path/to/your/mcp_server/main.py
            ```
        *   Ensure the Python environment has all necessary dependencies installed (e.g., `pip install -r requirements.txt`).
    *   **For Production (Containerization with Docker Compose):**
        *   **Dockerfile:** Create a `Dockerfile` for the Python MCP server to containerize it, ensuring all dependencies are bundled.
        *   **docker-compose.yml Integration:** Add the Python MCP server as a new service in the existing `docker-compose.yml` file. This service should be configured to depend on the Go backend services to ensure they are running before the MCP server starts.
        *   **Example `docker-compose.yml` Snippet (Conceptual):**
            ```yaml
            services:
              # ... existing Go services ...

              mcp-server:
                build: ./path/to/your/mcp_server_directory
                ports:
                  - "8000:8000" # Or any other port the MCP server listens on
                environment:
                  TRACKER_API_ENDPOINT: http://go-backend-service-name:8080 # Link to your Go backend service
                depends_on:
                  - go-backend-service-name # Ensure Go services are up
            ```
        *   After updating `docker-compose.yml`, run `docker-compose up --build` again to bring up the new MCP server service.

### 3. Host Application Configuration
*   **Task:** Configure the MCP-compliant host application (e.g., Claude Desktop, VS Code) to connect to the running universal MCP server.
*   **Details:** The host application will need to be configured with the address and port where the Python MCP server is running (e.g., `http://localhost:8000` if running locally via Docker Compose). This configuration is specific to each host application (e.g., `claude_desktop_config.json` for Claude Desktop, or settings within a VS Code extension).

By following these steps, the AI Context Gap Tracker can function as a truly universal MCP tool, providing its context management and prompt enhancement capabilities to a wide range of AI-powered applications.
### 2. Configure Claude Desktop
*   **Task:** Instruct Claude Desktop to recognize and use the newly created Python MCP server.
*   **Details:**
    *   Locate or create the `claude_desktop_config.json` file:
        *   macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
        *   Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
    *   Add a new entry under `mcpServers` pointing to your Python MCP server. This entry will specify the command to run the server and any necessary environment variables (e.g., the endpoint of your Go tracker).
    *   **Example Configuration Snippet:**
        ```json
        {
          "mcpServers": {
            "context-gap-tracker": {
              "command": "python",
              "args": [
                "/path/to/your/mcp_server/main.py" // Replace with actual path
              ],
              "env": {
                "TRACKER_API_ENDPOINT": "http://localhost:8080" // Adjust if your Go server runs on a different port
              }
            }
          }
        }
        ```

### 3. Restart Claude Desktop
*   **Task:** Ensure Claude Desktop reloads its configuration and initializes the new MCP server.
*   **Details:** After modifying `claude_desktop_config.json`, close and reopen Claude Desktop to apply the changes.

### 4. Test Integration
*   **Task:** Verify that Claude Desktop can successfully interact with the AI Context Gap Tracker's MCP tools.
*   **Details:** Experiment with prompts in Claude Desktop that would trigger the `rewrite_prompt` or `audit_response` tools, observing the behavior and checking logs for successful communication.
