# AI Context Gap Tracker - TODO List

This document outlines potential pitfalls in the AI Context Gap Tracker project, both at the idea and implementation levels, along with proposed corrections.

## Idea-Level Pitfalls

### 1. Ambiguous Definition of "Context Gap"
*   **Pitfall:** The term "context gap" is broad and lacks a precise definition, which can hinder effective identification, measurement, and addressing of these gaps.
*   **Correction:** Clearly define what constitutes a "context gap" within the project's scope. For example, "the absence of critical user-provided information required for an AI model to generate an accurate and relevant response, leading to a low confidence score or a generic output." This definition should guide the development of the `contexttracker` and `responseauditor` modules.

### 2. Over-reliance on a Single AI Model/Approach
*   **Pitfall:** Designing the system around a single AI model can lead to rigidity and difficulty in adapting to new models or evolving AI capabilities.
*   **Correction:** Design the `logicengine` and `promptrewriter` to be model-agnostic. Use abstract interfaces for AI model interactions, allowing for easy swapping or integration of different models (e.g., via an adapter pattern) to ensure future flexibility.

### 3. Lack of Clear Success Metrics
*   **Pitfall:** Without quantifiable metrics, it's challenging to determine if the "context gap tracker" is effectively improving AI performance or user experience.
*   **Correction:** Establish clear, measurable success metrics such as: reduction in AI model hallucination rates, increase in user satisfaction scores, decrease in interaction turns, or improved accuracy of AI responses. The `responseauditor` module should be used to collect data for these metrics.

## Implementation-Level Pitfalls

### 1. Scalability Bottlenecks (Database & Redis)
*   **Pitfall:** The database (`internal/database/database.go`) and Redis (`pkg/redis/redis.go`) could become performance bottlenecks under increased load if not optimized.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Database:** Implement proper indexing, connection pooling, and consider sharding or replication. Regularly review and optimize slow queries.
    *   **Redis:** Optimize Redis usage for caching and session management. Ensure efficient key design and consider Redis Cluster for high availability and horizontal scaling.

### 2. Performance of NLP and Prompt Rewriting
*   **Pitfall:** The Python NLP component (`python-nlp/`) and the `promptrewriter` could introduce significant latency due to complex computations or external API calls.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Asynchronous Processing:** Implement asynchronous processing for NLP tasks using message queues to decouple the main request flow from heavy computations.
    *   **Caching:** Cache results of frequently rewritten prompts or NLP analyses in Redis.
    *   **Optimization:** Profile and optimize the Python NLP code. Consider using optimized NLP libraries or pre-trained models.
    *   **Batching:** Batch multiple NLP requests if applicable to reduce overhead.

### 3. Inter-service Communication (Go and Python)
*   **Pitfall:** Inefficient or unreliable communication between the Go backend and the Python NLP service can lead to errors, latency, and data inconsistencies.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Robust API:** Implement a robust, well-defined API (e.g., RESTful HTTP or gRPC) with proper error handling, timeouts, and retries.
    *   **Containerization:** Use Docker (`Dockerfile`, `python-nlp/Dockerfile`) and Docker Compose (`docker-compose.yml`) for consistent deployment and environment management.
    *   **Health Checks:** Implement health checks for both services to ensure they are running and responsive.

### 4. Data Consistency and Integrity
*   **Pitfall:** Maintaining data consistency across different components and storage layers can be challenging.
*   **Correction:** Implement transactional operations where necessary. Use database constraints and validation rules to maintain data integrity. Consider eventual consistency models for less critical data if performance is paramount.

### 5. Error Handling and Observability
*   **Pitfall:** Poor error handling can lead to silent failures, and a lack of logging/monitoring makes debugging difficult.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Centralized Logging:** Implement structured logging across all components and send logs to a centralized system. Include relevant context in logs.
    *   **Metrics and Monitoring:** Integrate with a monitoring system (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) to collect metrics on API response times, error rates, and performance. Define alerts for critical thresholds.
    *   **Robust Error Handling:** Implement comprehensive error handling with clear error messages and appropriate error types.

### 6. Security
*   **Pitfall:** Handling sensitive data or API keys without proper security measures can lead to breaches.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Environment Variables:** Use environment variables for sensitive configurations (e.g., API keys, database credentials) as suggested by `.env.example`.
    *   **Input Validation:** Validate all inputs to prevent injection attacks.
    *   **Access Control:** Implement proper authentication and authorization for API endpoints. Consider RBAC.
    *   **Data Encryption:** Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit.

### 7. Maintainability and Testability
*   **Pitfall:** A complex system without clear separation of concerns or adequate testing can become difficult to maintain and extend.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Modular Design:** Continue with the modular design and ensure clear interfaces between modules.
    *   **Unit and Integration Tests:** Write comprehensive unit tests and integration tests. Ensure the existing `scripts/test_system.sh` is thorough.
    *   **Documentation:** Maintain up-to-date documentation for the API (`docs/API.md`) and deployment (`docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`).
